                                <p>In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be
                                    made and presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled
                                    with content hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible
                                    content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to focus on the
                                    text, disregarding the layout and its elements.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                                    demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
                                    pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                                    through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
                                    are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
                                    and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
                                    every pain avoided. </p>
